Therapist: I’m the psychiatrist here in this department.
User: I came to see you because my GP sent me to see you didn’t he?
Therapist: Yeah, yeah.
User: He said come and see a trick cyclist cos then you’ll be alright.
Therapist: Come and see a...? - A trick cyclist...a psychiatrist?
User: Yeah. He’s not had time to listen to me you see.... Ok. ....cause he’s a GP, he’s a doctor.......but I don’t think he’s very clever. He’s not very clever because he’s not, ok....getting to this you see, he won’t let me talk about this. He sort of listens to it sometime but then sometimes he doesn’t.
Therapist: Right. Can I just clarify why you are here and why I’m here, I’m the psychiatrist...
User: Well I’ve come to see you....in the emergency clinic today.
Therapist: Ok....and your GP has asked me to see you?
User: So that’s why I’m here. - Is that right? - Yeah cos I got to tell you about this, there’s important stuff in there. Really important stuff... - Ok, well before we start with that I come to see you.
Therapist: Can I just ask you what would you like me to call you- What name?
User: Yeah. - Name, name is a game, I don’t bother with names, that’s just too good...Right, ok....call me Audry.
Therapist: Ok, I am the psychiatrist over here.... Ok. - Now what is...Audry....can I ask you how old are you Audry?
User: How old, oh don’t, you’re only as old as the woman you feel aren’t you? I feel quite young and better than most women in their twenties.
Therapist: Right ok, so how old would that make you Audry?
